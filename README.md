# MORYX Template

Recommended repository template for quickly starting the development of MORYX modules, plugins or entire applications. This template has the necessary package feeds, a front-end and back-end solution, each with a launchable *StartProject*. Just clone the repository, open the solution and run the application to check. You can then add more packages or start developing your own MORYX packages.
